<h2>HOW DID HE BECOME CAPTAIN AMERICA</h2>
<p>Steve Rogers became Captain America during World War II through a secret U.S. government experiment called Project Rebirth. Though physically weak, Rogers had a brave heart and unshakable morals, which made him the ideal candidate for the Super-Soldier Serum developed by Dr. Abraham Erskine. The serum transformed him into the peak of human potentialâ€”strong, agile, and resilient. After Erskine was assassinated, Steve became the only successful super-soldier and was soon deployed as the patriotic symbol of hope: Captain America, fighting threats both during the war and, later, in the modern world after being revived from suspended animation.</p>
