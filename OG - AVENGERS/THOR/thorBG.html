<h2>HOW DID HE BECOME THE GOD OF THUNDER</h2>
<p>Thor was born with incredible strength and the ability to manipulate lightning, thanks to his Asgardian heritage. His journey to become the true God of Thunder began when his impulsiveness and thirst for battle led Odin to strip him of his powers. Cast down to Earth without his hammer, Thor was forced to grow emotionally, learning compassion, responsibility, and wisdom. His worthiness was restored, reuniting him with Mjolnir and solidifying his identityâ€”not just as a warrior, but a protector. His evolving powers, especially post-Ragnarok and Infinity War, highlight his deepening connection to lightning itself, beyond mere weapons.</p>
